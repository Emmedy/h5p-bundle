# H5PBundle
Bundle to integrate H5P into Symfony. This bundle is a port of the H5P Drupal module. For more info about H5P see [H5P.org](https://h5p.org)

For Symfony 3.X => [H5PBundle for Symfony 2.X and 3.X](https://github.com/Emmedy/h5p-bundle)

This bundle was tested on Symfony 4.X and Symfony 5.X

Installation
------------

Install with composer
``` bash
composer require jorisdugue/h5p-bundle
```

Enable the bundle in `AppKernel.php`
```php
return [
// ...
    \Studit\H5PBundle\StuditH5PBundle::class => ['all' => true]
]
```
**Warning for Windows** : You need launch the cmd in administrator

Add the H5P assets to the bundle
``` bash
php bin/console h5p-bundle:IncludeAssetsCommand
php bin/console assets:install --symlink
```
and reexecute ...
```bash
php bin/console h5p-bundle:IncludeAssetsCommand
```
  

Add required tables and relations to the database
``` bash
php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force 
```
or 
````bash
php bin/console make:migrations
````

Enable the routing in `routes.yaml`
```yaml
studit_h5p.demo:
    resource: "@StuditH5PBundle/Resources/config/routing_demo.yml"
    prefix:   /

studit_h5p:
    resource: "@StuditH5PBundle/Resources/config/routes.yaml"
    prefix:   /
```

studit_h5p.demo is optional. It can be used as an example how to use H5P within Symfony and test if this bundle is working properly.

Configuration
-------------

For SF4: 
Configure the bundle in `services.yaml`. (Watch for the underscore between h5 and p)
```yaml
parameters:
    studit_h5_p:
        use_permission: true # This is false by default to let the demo work out of the box.
        storage_dir: / # Location to store all H5P libraries and files
        web_dir: public # Location of the public web directory
        export: 3 #for all
        embed: 3 #for all
```

For Symfony 5:
Configure the bundle in `packages > h5pBundle.yml`.
```yaml
studit_h5_p:
    use_permission: true # This is false by default to let the demo work out of the box.
    storage_dir: / # Location to store all H5P libraries and files
    web_dir: public # Location of the public web directory
    export: 3 #for all
    embed: 3 #for all
```

For all configurations see [Configuration.php](DependencyInjection/Configuration.php)

if you are using permissions here is the current list of permissions in the bundle :

| Permission  | Description |
|---|---|
| ROLE_H5P_DOWNLOAD_ALL  |  Download the H5P packages |
| ROLE_H5P_EMBED_ALL  | Embed/Share to everyone the H5P   |
| ROLE_H5P_CREATE_RESTRICTED_CONTENT_TYPES  | Restrict for user the type install  |
| ROLE_H5P_UPDATE_LIBRARIES  | Allow/Disallow the update of package H5P  |
| ROLE_H5P_INSTALL_RECOMMENDED_LIBRARIES  | Allow/Disallow to install libraries |
| ROLE_H5P_COPY_ALL  | Allow/Disallow to copy H5P (If you want to Download, you must install to have this role too) |

Usage
-------------

First add a virtual host that points to you project. Then in your browser go to `http://<your virtualhost>/h5p/list`

Todo
-------------
Working: 
- Store usage data and points (only if user is connected)
- Download a H5P
- Upload H5P
- Update / Install H5P library
- Store usage data and points

Not everything is ported yet. The following things still need to be done:
* Upload library. Currently only H5P default libraries can be selected from Hub. (need custom h5p for testing )

Changelog: 
-------------
- Fix bug and update the readme
- Fix many bug ... and update to SF5 :) 
- Fix bug with missing link img 
- Fix Download package
- Store usage data and points
